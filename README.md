# Unreal Easy Injector
Play many esp. first person Unreal Engine games in VR!  
Replacing the old UEVR Injector with a much more user friendly, easy to use and automated app.  
It auto-scans you Steam/EPIC/GOG installed games and replaces tools like launcher, UEVRInjector, OpenXR switchers.

Most profile websites are outdated, profiles floating in Discord discussions, hard to discover.
UEVR Easy Injector contains a web database for easy discovery and installation, plus adds authors information on how to use the profiles.

It uses [PrayDogs UEVR engine](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR) but does not need an UEVR installation.

## Installation
Simply download the setup program from the release section.  
Some virus scanner mark the UEVR engine as a false positive, because it (suspiciously) injects itself into other game apps.
Please add an exception for UEVR in your antivirus software if necessary.
Do **not** run the classical UEVR injector in parallel (side by side install is no problem, just not start them).

## Submitting profiles
Please only submit tested profiles, not work in progress.  
In the "Edit profile" screen is a "Publish" button. It cleans you profile from temp files like logs and dumps and packs it up in a ZIP, 
with some standardized variables.
On first submit it will generate two files in the profiles folder (if not existing already).  
Add descriptive data in these files (see below). 
Then publish again, and post the resulting ZIP file on this [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/747967102895390741/947806014344925274)

### ProfileMeta.json
Open with a text editor and fill in especially your authors name, a SHORT remark.

### ProfileDescription.md

The attention span these days is short. Simple bullet points, keep it short.
